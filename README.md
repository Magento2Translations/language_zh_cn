# Looking for maintainer
These [Magento2Translations](http://magento2translations.github.io/) packages are unmaintained. This means that from time to time we will run the sync and build from Crowdin. But we probably won't add Magento/Crowdin versions. If you would like to continue the work done here please send us a message.

Have a look at all the other great community maintained packages at [e-conomix/magento-translations](https://github.com/e-conomix/magento-translations).
Or [Mageplaza maintained packages](https://github.com/mageplaza?q=language).
